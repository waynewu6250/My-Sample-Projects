    "In this notebook, you will implement a data processing pipeline using tools from both Keras and the tf.data module. You will use the `ImageDataGenerator` class in the tf.keras module to feed a network with training and test images from a local directory containing a subset of the LSUN dataset, and train the model both with and without data augmentation. You will then use the `map` and `filter` functions of the `Dataset` class with the CIFAR-100 dataset to train a network to classify a processed subset of the images.\n",
