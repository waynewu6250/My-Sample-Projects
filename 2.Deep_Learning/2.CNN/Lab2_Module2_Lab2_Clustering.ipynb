    "Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments to make the image easier to analyze.  Often we are looking to locate objects and boundaries in the original image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A more precise way of looking at it is to say that image segmentation's goal is to assign a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.  \n",

    "# _K_-means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "The term '_k_-means' dates from 1967 but the standard algorithm is generally credited to Stuart Lloyd in 1957. _k_-means clustering aims to partition _n_ observations into _k_ clusters such that each observation is in the cluster with the nearest mean to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the problem is computationally difficult (NP-hard).  However, heuristic algorithms are normally employed and these converge quickly.\n",

    "The most common algorithm uses an iterative refinement technique.  Due to its ubiquity it is often just called the\n",
    "_k_-means algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "Arbitrarily pick any one pixel from the image and make that the center of cluster one.\n",
    "Then pick any other pixel from the image and make that the center of cluster two.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm proceeds by alternating between the following two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Assignment Step:* Assign each pixel to the 'closest' cluster.  Proximity is normally calculated using Euclidean distance.\n",
    "2. *Update the means of the clusters:* Calculate the new means of the pixels in the new clusters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the assignments no longer change or for a fixed number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
